According to mythology, Rome was founded in 753 B.C. by Romulus and Remus, twin sons of Mars, the Roman god of war. Left to drown in a basket on the Tiber by a king of nearby Alba Longa and rescued by a she-wolf, the twins lived to defeat that king and found their own city on the riverâ€™s banks in 753 B.C. After killing his brother, Romulus became the first king of Rome, which is named for him.
