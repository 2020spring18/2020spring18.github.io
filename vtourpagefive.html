The Holy Roman Empire, founded by Charlemange in 800 AD, was recognized by Medieval western Europeans as the legitimate continuation of the ancient Roman Empire due to its emperors having been proclaimed as Roman emperors by the Papacy. However, it is often debated whether this is true or not. Most historians claim that the Byzantine Empire was the true successor to the ancient Roman Empire, however, the Holy Roman Empire controlled Rome until it's dissolvement in 1806. Rome, for the first time since the fall of the western Roman empire, was controlled by an ethnically Roman state in 1870 when the Kingdom of Italy captured the city.
