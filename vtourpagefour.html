After the reign of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, the emperors who succeeded him could not manage the responsibility of keeping the Roman Empire afloat and the empire slowly started to crumble. The Roman Empire eventually split into two empires, the western Roman empire and the eastern Roman Empire. Rome fell along with the western Roman empire in In 476 C.E. when Romulus, the last of the Roman emperors in the west, was overthrown by the Germanic leader Odoacer, who became the first Barbarian to rule in Rome. The eastern Roman empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire, experienced relative prosperity for about a thousand years after the fall of Rome.
