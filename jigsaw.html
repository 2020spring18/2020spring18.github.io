</p> 
  <h1> M.A.N.I.A Jigsaw Activity </h1>
<p> For this activity, assert yourselves into the pre-assigned groups of five. Each expert group will be responsible for researching one of the causes of the Great War. After all groups have finished their research, each student will talk about their cause to those of a different expert group </p> 
<h2> Directions </h2>
<ol>
  <li> Find the partners you've been assigned through the Random Team Generator and assemble at a single table. </li>
  <li> Each table will be given a number from 1 to 5. The number you receive corresponds to the cause you will be researching. Use the table below to find links on information for your cause. </li>
  <li>Once your table is finished researching, form a group that has one member from each expert group. Take turns teaching your cause to the rest of the group. </li>
    <li>Return to your original seats and prepare for a quiz on the five causes of World War I. </li>
