		<ul>
		<li class="Q">Question 1: What is the technical definiton of the term <strong>Fair Use?</strong> 
		<a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/"> https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/ </a> </li>
			<li class="A">Answer: "Fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and “transformative” purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work." </li>
			
			<li class="Q">Question 2: What is the law that <strong>Fair Use</strong> is protected under?

		<a href="https://www.multiplechronicconditions.org/fair-use-act-disclaimer">https://www.multiplechronicconditions.org/fair-use-act-disclaimer</a></li>
			<li class="A">Answer: The Fair Use Act of 1976 allows for the protection of Fair Use rights. </li>
		
		<li class="Q">Question 3: How does <strong>Fair Use</strong> apply to me as a student? 
		<a href="https://info.legalzoom.com/article/examples-fair-use-copyright-laws-classroom">https://info.legalzoom.com/article/examples-fair-use-copyright-laws-classroom</a></li>
			<li class="A">Answer: Any schoolwork that students produce which involve the use of copyrighted material, such as excerpts from novels, music, and movies, are protected by Fair Use.  </li>
			
			<li class="Q">Question 4: What are the conditions that need to be met to fall under <strong>Fair Use?</strong>
			<a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/disagreements-over-fair-use-when-are-you-likely-to-get-sued/">https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/disagreements-over-fair-use-when-are-you-likely-to-get-sued/</a></li>
		<li class="A"> Answer: You can't use Fair Use as a way of displaying the enitrety of a copyrighted entity. For example, if you are critiquing a book, you cannot show all the pages of the novel in your critque, only small excerpts. If you do decide to do this, you can cause the copyright owner to lose money and therefore may encounter a lawsuit. </li>
			
		
		<li class="Q">Question 5: Are there alternatives to using content (specifically media) under <strong>Fair Use?</strong>
			
			<a href="https://www.baylor.edu/copyright/student/index.php?id=56162">https://www.baylor.edu/copyright/student/index.php?id=56162</a></li>
			
			<li class="A"> Answer: Royalty-free art and music are great examples of copyright-free content that you can use if you fear legal issues, as there are no Fair Use laws for this type of content, so you can use it freely. </li>
			
		</ul>
		
		
   		

		<p><strong>True or False?</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Fair Use</strong> allows for brief use of copyrighted materials.</li>
			<li class="A"> True, this is the reason why you can go on the internet and find rants, critiques, and reviews about copyrighted media. </li>
			<li>Under <strong>Fair Use</strong>, a person is immune to all legal reprocussions.</li>
			<li class="A">False,you are not completely immune from legal consquences if the copyright owner decides to pursue a lawsuit.</li>
